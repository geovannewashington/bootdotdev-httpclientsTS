## The Protocol

The 'protocol' also called the 'scheme' is the first component of a URL.

Some examples of different protocols:

- http
- ftp
- mailto
- https (the encrypted, more secure version of http)

### Not All Schemas Requre a '//'

A schema is always followed by ':', but the '//' part is only for schemeas that have an authority component.

What is an authority component?
The authority of a URI is the section that comes after the scheme and before the path.
