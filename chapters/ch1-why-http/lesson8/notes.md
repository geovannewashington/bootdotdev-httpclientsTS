# JavaScript's Fetch API

When you make an HTTP request using fetch(), the fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves
to a Response object.

The .json() method is then called on this response object to extract and parse the JSON data from
the response body.

The fetch api is only avaible in the browser, NodeJS doesn't provide a fetch api.
